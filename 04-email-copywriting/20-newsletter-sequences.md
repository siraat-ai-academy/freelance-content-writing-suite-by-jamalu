## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
Newsletter sequences are a **series of timed emails** sent to subscribers to move them through a journey — from interest to trust, from follower to fan.

Unlike a one-off campaign, sequences are **strategic storytelling arcs**. They’re not blasts. They’re letters — each one crafted to educate, connect, or offer gentle value. Whether you're onboarding new subscribers, launching a product, or simply deepening your relationship, this is your **soulful follow-up system**.

- Each email ~150–300 words (varies by purpose)  
- Sequencing designed for clarity, pacing, and reader trust  
- Emotional arc mapped across the series (story, solution, invitation)

Jamalu makes sure every message *feels* like it came from someone real — because it did.
