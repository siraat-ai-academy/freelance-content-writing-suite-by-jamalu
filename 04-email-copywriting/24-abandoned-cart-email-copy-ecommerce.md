It says: *Hey, you left something behind. Still interested?*  
It offers clarity, encouragement, sometimes a small incentive.  

This kind of email bridges the gap between **browsing and buying**, and it's one of the most **powerful tools** in eCommerce to **recover lost sales** — especially when it’s written with empathy, not just urgency.
