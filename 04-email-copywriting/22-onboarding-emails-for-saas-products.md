## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
Think of onboarding emails like the **tour guide for your product**.

It’s the gentle sequence that helps a new user **get started**, **stay motivated**, and **see early wins**. These aren’t sales pitches — they’re relationship builders. From a welcome message to feature highlights to check-ins, each email builds clarity, trust, and comfort.

The goal? Help users feel **capable**, not confused.
