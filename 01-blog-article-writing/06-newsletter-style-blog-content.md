## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
This is writing that **feels like being spoken to** — not at.

**Newsletter-style blogs** borrow the tone and intimacy of a well-loved email digest. They may include personal reflection, curated resources, brand updates, or useful tips — but always delivered with warmth, not noise.

This is not “just another blog post.”  
It’s a letter with a purpose, a mirror with a message.

## 💼 02. What Jamalu Will Do for You  
You’ll receive a fully written blog post (typically **700–1100 words**) that feels more like a **shared note** than a sales pitch.

Expect:

- One or more **narrative arcs** (personal story, insight, or theme)  
- A curated section (optional: tools, links, quotes, news)

The tone will match your brand’s voice, while keeping the human at the center.
