## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
A **lead magnet** is a free, valuable resource — often in the form of an eBook, guide, or short PDF — offered in exchange for a visitor’s email or interest.

It’s not salesy. It’s sincere.  

It teaches something useful.  
It positions your brand as helpful.  
And it opens a quiet, trusted door to ongoing connection.

## 💼 02. What Jamalu Will Do for You  
Your lead magnet will include:

- **A compelling title** that sparks curiosity  
- **Introduction** that frames the reader’s challenge or desire  
- **3–7 clear, helpful sections**, each offering practical insight  
- **Simple formatting cues** for design (headings, bullets, pull quotes)  
- **A soft CTA** to invite next steps — not pressure, but partnership

Typical word count: **1,000–2,000 words** depending on your topic.

Jamalu ensures the voice is yours — only clearer, warmer, more compelling.

## 🎯 03. Why This Matters for Your Brand  
A good lead magnet does many things at once:

- Builds your **authority** in a focused niche or service  
- Delivers **value first**, earning trust before asking for action  
- Creates **shareable, evergreen content** for launches or funnels  

It’s **free content**, yes. But deeply **strategic** in how it opens hearts — and inboxes.
