## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
This is your **digital origin story** — the heart behind the brand.

The **About Page** is where you stop selling and start **relating**. It’s where your reader meets the *you* behind the logo — and gets a glimpse of the mission that moves you. When written well, it’s not just informative. It’s **emotionally anchoring**.

It tells them:  
> "You belong here. And this is why we do what we do."

- Expression of **values**, mission, or “why”  
- Optional founder bio or team highlights
