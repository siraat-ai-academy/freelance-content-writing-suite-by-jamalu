**On-Page SEO Copywriting** is the art of writing content that speaks fluently to both humans and search engines.

It means making your website pages:

- Easy to find (with **keywords**)  
- Easy to navigate (with **headings** + **internal links**)  
- Easy to understand (with clear, warm **tone**)
