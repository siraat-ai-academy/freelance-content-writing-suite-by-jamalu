## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
Schema markup is a special language made for search engines — a gentle whisper beneath your content that says:  
_"Here’s what this is. Here’s who it’s for. Here’s how it helps."_

This task recommends the **right structured data types** (like `Article`, `FAQ`, `Review`, `Breadcrumb`, etc.) for your blog or website content.  
It’s a technical bridge to **clarity, discoverability**, and **semantic accuracy**.
