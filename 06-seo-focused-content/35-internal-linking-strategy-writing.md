## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
At its core, **internal linking** is about connecting the pages within your own website in a way that feels natural, helpful, and strategic.  

Imagine a guest arriving at your homepage. Where should they go next?  
Which article should they read after this one?  

An internal linking strategy answers those questions — **gently guiding**, not pushing.  
It also tells **search engines** what content is most important and how pages relate. It’s UX and **SEO** in one breath.

## 💼 02. What Eks2 Will Do for You  
You’ll receive a custom-written internal linking strategy that includes:

- A list of **key pages** and where they should point  
- **Anchor text suggestions** that feel organic and natural  
- Integration into current or refreshed content (if applicable)  
- Notes on **link hierarchy** and **semantic structure**  
- Clear recommendations for ongoing use  

Whether you have 10 pages or 100, I’ll make sure your site flows with clarity and **intentional direction**.
