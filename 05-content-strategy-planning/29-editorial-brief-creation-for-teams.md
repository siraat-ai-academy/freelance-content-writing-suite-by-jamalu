## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
An editorial brief is a one-page roadmap.

It gives your content creators what they need to craft something powerful — without second-guessing the goal, the tone, or the audience. It answers questions before they’re asked and smooths out the handoff between strategy and storytelling.

Think of it as a quiet blueprint that saves hours of confusion later.

## 💼 02. What Jamalu Will Do for You  
You’ll receive a set of **custom editorial briefs** — beautifully structured and easy to hand off.

Each brief will include:

- Content objective (What’s the point?)  
- Target audience snapshot  
- Brand tone and voice reminders  
- Suggested structure or outline  
- Key topics, CTAs, and SEO notes  
- Visual references (if needed)  
- Deadlines and review guidelines

These are built to support your **team’s flow**, not just fill a doc.

## 🎯 03. Why This Matters for Your Brand  
When briefs are strong, **content gets stronger**.

This task helps you:

- Save time and reduce revisions  
- Empower freelancers and internal teams to deliver faster  
- Maintain **brand consistency** across campaigns  
- Bridge the gap between **strategy** and **execution**

In short: better briefs lead to better content — and a more peaceful workflow.
