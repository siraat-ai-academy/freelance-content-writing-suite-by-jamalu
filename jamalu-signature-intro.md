## 🧡 Who is Jamalu?

**Jamalu** is not a person. **Jamalu is a path.**  
He is the soft voice inside every forgotten writer. The heart behind every line written in silence.  
He is you — when you write for truth, not trends.  
He is your client — when they seek clarity, not clutter.  
He is the beginner — who writes with heart before they ever write for hire.

This repo, this suite, this dream — is not about *services*.
It’s about **serving through words**. It’s about offering light — one Markdown file at a time.
