## 🧭 01. What This Task Really Is  
This is the art of writing **tiny windows of connection**.

Social captions aren’t just filler for pretty pictures. They’re your brand’s breath — short, human, and immediate. Whether playful, poetic, or promotional, these lines carry your **tone**, spark **engagement**, and keep your presence **consistent and compelling** across the feed.

They meet your audience where they are — and bring them just a little closer.
