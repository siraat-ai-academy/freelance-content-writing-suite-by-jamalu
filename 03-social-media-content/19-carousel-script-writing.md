Carousel script writing is the art of telling a story — one **bite-sized insight at a time**.

It’s like turning your brain’s wisdom into something your audience can tap through — and take with them.

- A **strong hook slide** and a **powerful CTA** at the end  
- Messaging aligned with your brand tone (bold, calm, quirky, professional…)  
- Optional: brief **visual cues** for each slide (e.g., “use icon here,” “contrast background”)
